        "List and tuple are two data structures in Python that can store multiple values in a specific order¹. They have some similarities and differences, which I will summarize below:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Mutability**: List is mutable, meaning you can change its elements after creation. Tuple is immutable, meaning you cannot change its elements once created².\n",
        "- **Syntax**: List is surrounded by square brackets `[]`, while tuple is surrounded by parentheses `()`¹. For example, `list_num = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `tup_num = (1, 2, 3, 4)`.\n",
        "- **Performance**: Tuple is faster than list for large collections of data, because it is stored in a single memory block and does not require extra space for new objects². List is slower than tuple, because it is allocated in two blocks and requires more memory³.\n",
        "- **Operations**: List has more built-in methods than tuple, such as `append`, `insert`, `remove`, `sort`, etc. Tuple has fewer built-in methods, such as `count` and `index`¹. You can use `dir(list)` and `dir(tuple)` to see all the available methods for each data structure⁴.\n",
        "- **Usage**: List is better for performing operations that require changing the data, such as insertion and deletion. Tuple is better for accessing the data and ensuring its integrity². List is also more suitable for heterogeneous data (different types of values), while tuple is more suitable for homogeneous data (same type of values).\n",
